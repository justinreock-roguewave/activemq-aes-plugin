# activemq-aes-plugin
## Plugin to AES Encrypt Message Payloads in ActiveMQ

This plugin will allow encryption at rest while storing messages in a persistence store like KahaDB.

# INSTALL
Compile with Maven and drop the resulting .jar in ActiveMQ's classpath

# CONFIGURE

Add a system property called activemq.aeskey to ActiveMQ's JVM options, with a 16-digit AES key, such as:

`-Dactivemq.aeskey=oneactivemqkey4u`

Update activemq.xml to load the plugin, by adding a block similar to the following:

`<plugins>

    <bean xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" id="aesPlugin" class="com.roguewave.oss.activemq.ActiveMQAESBrokerPlugin"/>

</plugins>`

Upon restarting the broker, the plugin will log a message that it has loaded.

You can validate that the messages are encrypting by browsing pending messages inside of a queue.  You will see a base64 encoded string as opposed to your message payload.
